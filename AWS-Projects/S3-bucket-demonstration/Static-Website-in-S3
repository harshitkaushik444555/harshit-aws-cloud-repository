1. To host static website create a bucket and put index.html file in it.
2. go to bucket properties and scroll to static website hosting
3. edit it and enable it
4. give html document name and save.
5. but the public access is blocked so unblock it and access website using url.
6. but website will not be accessible bcoz you will have to add a bucket policy to give permission to everyone to access bucket as follows

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
